### 820. Short Encoding of Words
Given a list of words, we may encode it by writing a reference string `S` and a list of indexes `A`.

For example, if the list of words is `["time", "me", "bell"]`, we can write it as `S = "time#bell#"` and `indexes = [0, 2, 5]`.

Then for each index, we will recover the word by reading from the reference string from that index until we reach a "#" character.

What is the length of the shortest reference string `S` possible that encodes the given words?

Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
